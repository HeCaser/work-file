# The JavaScript this Keyword

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

不同的 this 代表不同的意义

**注意**

this 不是变量,是关键字,用户不可修改

## this in a Method

When used in an object method, this refers to the object.

## this Alone

When used alone, this refers to the global object.

Because this is running in the global scope.

In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:


## this in a Function (Default)

In a function, the global object is the default binding for this.

In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:

Example

```
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
```

## this in a Function (Strict)

JavaScript strict mode does not allow default binding.

So, when used in a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.

Example

```
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
```

## this in Event Handlers

In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:

```
<button onclick="this.style.display='none'">
  Click to Remove Me!
</button>
```

## Object Method Binding

In these examples, this is the person object:

```
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```

# JavaScript Arrow Function

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Before
```
hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

After
```
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:

```
hello = () => "Hello World!";
```

If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:

```
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;
```

In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

```
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
```

## What About this?

The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.

In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of this.

In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

Let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference.

Both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, and once again when the user clicks a button.

The first example uses a regular function, and the second example uses an arrow function.

The result shows that the first example returns two different objects (window and button), and the second example returns the window object twice, because the window object is the "owner" of the function.

# JavaScript Classes

ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.

JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.
