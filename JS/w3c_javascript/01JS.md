# JavaScript Output

[Demo: Output](demo/js_output.html)

## JavaScript Display Possibilities

jS 可以用下面四个方式 `展示` 数据

-Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.

-Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.

-Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.

-Writing into the browser console, using `console.log()`.


## Using innerHTML

To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the `document.getElementById(id)` method.

The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:


## Using document.write()

**注意**: 
- Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:

- The document.write() method should **only be used for testing**.

```
<script>
document.write(5 + 6);
</script>
```

## Using window.alert()

```
<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>
```

**重点**

- You can skip the `window` keyword.

- In JavaScript, `the window object is the global scope object`. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional:

```
<script>
alert(5 + 6);
</script>
```

## Using console.log()

For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.

```
<script>
console.log(5 + 6);
</script>
```

## JavaScript Print

JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.

You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.

The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

# JavaScript Statements

## JavaScript Programs

- A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

- In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

- A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

**In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.**

## JavaScript Statements

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

## Semicolons (分号)

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

```
let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c
```

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

`a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;`

> On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
> Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.

## JavaScript White Space (空格)

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

`let x = y + z;` 

## JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

## JavaScript Code Blocks

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

```
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
```

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

# JavaScript Syntax

## JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values  (常量)

- Variable values (变量)

## JavaScript Literals(常量)

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

```
10.50

1001
```

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
```
"John Doe"

'John Doe'
```

## JavaScript Variables (变量)

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords `var, let and const` to declare variables.


## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses `arithmetic operators ( + - * / )` to compute values:`(5 + 6) * 10`


## JavaScript Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings. `"John" + " " + "Doe"`

## JavaScript Comments (注释)

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

## JavaScript Identifiers / Names

> 命名规则

Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

- A letter (A-Z or a-z)
- A dollar sign ($)
- Or an underscore (_)

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive

> JS 是大小写敏感语音

## JavaScript and Camel Case (驼峰规则)

Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

## JavaScript Character Set (使用国际统一字符集)

JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
